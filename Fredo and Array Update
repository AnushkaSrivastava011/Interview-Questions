Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. His task is to update all
elements of array to some minimum value x , that is,  A[i]=x, 1<=i<=N ; such that sum of this new
array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that x should be as minimum as possible
such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.
Input Format:
First line of input consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A.
Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array elements.
Output Format:
The only line of output consists of the value of x.
Input Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10 power 5
1 <= A[i] <= 1000
SAMPLE INPUT
5
1 2 3 4 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT
4
Explanation
Initial sum of array = 1+2+3+4+5=15
When we update all elements to 4, sum of array =4+4+4+4+4=20 which is greater than 15.
Note that if we had updated the array elements to 3, sum=15 which is not greater than 15. So, 4 is the
minimum value to which array elements need to be updated.

Solution:
import java.util.*;
class TestClass {
public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n=sc.nextInt();
int sum=0;
int arr[]=new int[n];
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
sum=sum+arr[i];
}
System.out.println((sum/n)+1);
}
}
