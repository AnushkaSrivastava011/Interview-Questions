Problem:-

Little Shino and Common factors
Little Shino loves maths. Today her teacher gave her two integers. Shino is now wondering how many integers can divide both the numbers. She is busy with her assignments. Help her to solve the problem.
Input: First line of the input le contains two integers, a and b.
Output: Print the number of common factors of a and b.
Constraints:
Explanation
The common factors of and are 1 and 5

solution
import java.util.*;

class TestClass {
	static long gcd(long a, long b)
	{
		if (a == 0) 
			return b;
		
		return gcd(b%a,a);
	}
	static long commDiv(long a,long b)
	{
		long n = gcd(a, b);
	
		long result = 0;
		for (int i=1; i<=Math.sqrt(n); i++)
		{
			if (n%i==0)
			{
				if (n/i == i)
					result += 1;
				else
					result += 2;
			}
		}
		return result;
	}

    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        long a=sc.nextLong();
        long b=sc.nextLong();
        System.out.println(commDiv(a, b));
    }
}
